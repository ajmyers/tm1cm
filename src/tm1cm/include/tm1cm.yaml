#     Filters can be defined as a single item, or as a list of items.

#   Note: This only includes the view definition, it does not include any data. It is recommended that any subsets included

#     Filters can be defined as a single item, or as a list of items.
#
#   Note: This is generally intended for moving smaller sets of data, like control cube values. It is not intended for moving large

#   Note: Only public views are supported. It's recommended to disable zero suppression on the view otherwise stale data may
#     be left behind on the target

#   Note: A 'dimension' is only a container of hierarchies. You must also configure 'include_dimension_hierarchy'

# Dimension Hierarchy:
#   Define a list of dimension hierarchies to include, and then exclude from tm1cm. Build a list using the 'include' filter, then filter
#     it further using the 'exclude' filter. Use * as a wildcard character anywhere. Filters can be defined as a single item,
#     or as a list of items.
#
#   Note: This will manage the migration of hierarchies, but will not explicitly include the elements of a hierarchy. In order to configure
#     including/excluding a hierarchies elements, see 'include_dimension_hierarchy_element'
#
#   Format: <DimensionName>/<HierarchyName>

# Dimension Hierarchy Elements:

#     or as a list of items.
#
#   Note: It is not recommended to include elements for hierarchies that are managed from other data sources (like upstream ERP)
#
#   Format: <DimensionName>/<HierarchyName>

# Dimension Hierarchy Attributes:
#   Define a list of dimension hierarchy attributes to include, and then exclude from tm1cm. Build a list using the 'include' filter, then filter

#
#   Note: This will only manage attributes themselves, it will not populate attribute values. In order to do that, see the

#   Format: <DimensionName>/<HierarchyName>/<AttributeName>
#   Examples:
#      - afLocation/afLocation/* -- include all attributes for afLocation dimension/hierarchy

# Dimension Hierarchy Attribute Values:

#
#   Note: This will, for any included elements, manage the attribute values for each element.
#
#   Format: <DimensionName>/<HierarchyName>/<AttributeName>
#   Examples:
#      - afLocation/afLocation/* -- include all attribute values for afLocation dimension/hierarchy

# Dimension Hierarchy Subset:

#     or as a list of items.
#
#   Note: This supports only public subsets. It will work for both Dynamic and Static subsets.
#
#   Format: <DimensionName>/<HierarchyName>/<SubsetName>
